After creating the dept, and emp two tables and inserting records - write the following queries

A) Find who is making Max Salary in Department 30   (use a child query)
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE deptno = 30
  AND sal = (SELECT MAX(sal) FROM emp WHERE deptno = 30);

B) Find who all are working in New York (use a child query)
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE deptno IN (SELECT deptno FROM dept WHERE loc = 'NEW YORK');

C) Find who are making more than Average Salary in Department 10 (use a child query)
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE deptno = 10
  AND sal > (SELECT AVG(sal) FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10);

D) Show Ename, SAL,  LOC for Department 10 and 20  (perform  a join)

GROUP BY d.dname
HAVING COUNT(e.empno) > 4;


N)Create two tables:  class A (id, fname, grade), Class B (id, fname, grade) , insert records, some records are in both tables, and some records are only exist in one of the table
Perform union, union all, minus and intersect:
-- Create table Class A
CREATE TABLE class_a (
    id number,
    fname varchar2(10),
